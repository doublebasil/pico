# Setup guide for pico

The debian dependency installer is a streamlined version of this script:
https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-setup
You can find more advice about the setup here
https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf
There's a lot of un-necessary stuff in Raspberry's setup script - my script just has the apt installs.

Incase you don't know, you can run the .sh files using
```
sudo chmod +x deb_deps_install.sh
./deb_deps_install.sh
```
